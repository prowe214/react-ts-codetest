## ⭐️ Candidate Instructions

We want you to use your own local code editor. But, if you absolutely cannot use your own code editor, please [follow this link](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts?file=index.html&terminal=dev) to use a web-based code editor.

1. **Share your screen!** We want to be able to see the following:
   - Your **terminal**, so we can see what commands you run
   - Your **code editor**, so we can see how you write code
   - Your **web browser**, so we can see the output
2. Clone this repository to your computer
3. Open the repository in your favorite code editor
4. Ask your interviewer which exercise you should complete, and open the appropriate branch as listed above
5. Install necessary dependencies
6. Run the application
7. Open `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for your remaining instructions
