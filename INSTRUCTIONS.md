# Instructions for Code Exercise

Complete the game logic by implementing the `handleCardClick` function in `MemoryGame.tsx`.

The game should:

- [ ] Allow flipping a maximum of 2 cards at a time
- [ ] Check if flipped cards match and flip non-matches back after a delay
- [ ] Track the number of moves (a move is when 2 cards are flipped)
- [ ] Detect when all cards are matched to end the game
- [ ] Display game over state with final move count

You may not finish in the time allotted, and that's okay â€” **we're most interested in hearing how you think through the problem and explain your approach**.

## Implementation Details

Your task is to implement the core game logic for the Memory Game. The UI components are already created for you, and you need to add the missing functionality to make the game interactive and functional.

### Tips:

- Use the existing state variables provided in the component
- Make sure to handle the timing of card flips correctly, particularly when cards need to remain visible temporarily before being hidden again
- Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure all game rules are enforced
