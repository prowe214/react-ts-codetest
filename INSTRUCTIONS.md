# Instructions for Code Exercise

We will create a **Random Number Generator**.

1. Open new branch
2. The UI will include:
   - One button
   - Two separate numbers
   - Ignore styles for this exercise
3. Behavior:
   - Pressing the button generates 2 random numbers (0-3)
     - Code for Random Number: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)`
   - The numbers are displayed in the UI
   - If the numbers match, show the word “MATCH!” in the UI
4. When complete, commit and push (the push command will fail, its okay, ignore)
